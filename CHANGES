Changes in version 0.2
----------------------
In the IOC App:
- moved scan routine from sub record to driver
- added blocking for crate-bound commands, basically serializing
   communications with the crate.  This should reduce hang-ups
   and crashes, and also reduce frequency of screwball readings.
- changed SCAN type of many of the input db records from Periodic to Event.
   - Assigned Event# 11 to fast scan, Event# 12 to medium scan,
      Event# 13 to slow scan, and Event# 10 for manual update.  Manual
      update have not been implemented yet.
   - the driver then posts these events as respective timers dictate.
   - input records initiallize with the above Event# in their init()
      routines, if the value is > 0.
- scan period has been assigned for each Param for future use
