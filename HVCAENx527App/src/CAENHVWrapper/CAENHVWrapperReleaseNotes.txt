  Determining Your Software Release
  ---------------------------------

  To determine the complete software release of the CAEN HV Wrapper Library
  installed in your machine, you can use the relevant menu choice of the demo 
  program.
  You will see something like: 
                               3.10-1.7 
  where: 3.10 is the Release of the CAENHVWrapper.dll described in this document
  and 1.7 is the Release of the HSCAENETlib.dll library used by the Wrapper 
  library for the communication with the CAENET Power Supplies (you will find 
  detailed info for that software in the HSCAENETReleaseNotes.txt document).
